# Fin, the Fyne Login Manager

A minimal but good-looking login manager for Linux/Unix.
The current boot scripts support only systemd on Linux and rc.d on OpenBSD.

If you'd like to try out this project in its early stages
then you can simply check out this repo and run (Linux with systemd assumed):

```shell
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ systemctl disable display-manager
$ systemctl enable fin
```

You can then either reboot or start fin directly with:

```shell
$ systemctl start fin
```

That should be all you need if you are transitioning away from
another Display Manager. If you run into issues using Fin,
please visit [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below.

### OpenBSD support

Fin builds and runs under OpenBSD as well. Since OpenBSD uses BSD Auth 
instead of PAM, you will need to get the OpenPAM dependency first and set proper rules by running:

```shell
$ doas pkg_add -U openpam
$ doas install -Dm00644 /etc/pam.d/system /etc/pam.d/display_manager
```

To run Fin under bare X on system boot, install it with commands as following. If you have some other display manager enabled, make sure you disable it first, so it doesn't conflict with Fin. Below we assume that you have got `xenodm`, and disable it explicitly:

```shell
$ doas make install
$ doas rcctl disable xenodm
$ doas rcctl enable fin
```

Reboot the system and Fin should start automatically during boot process.

# Development

The Fin login app can be tested easily by running as a normal
Fyne application (with `go run .`) or by running it within a
Xephyr window (we provide `make embed` to help).

Once you are ready to test as your display manager replacement,
you should execute `make && sudo make install` and restart the
`fin` service.


# Troubleshooting

## Logging in Fails
### Problem
When attempting to log in, authentication fails despite using
the correct username and password.
### Solution
Fin, like most other Display Managers, makes use of PAM, the
Pluggable Authentication Module system. This requires the
appropriate rules be in place. The following snippet creates a
`display_manager` module by copying the login one. It must be
run as `root`:
`install -Dm00644 /etc/pam.d/login /etc/pam.d/display_manager`


## Audio Issues
### Problem
I'm using PulseAudio, and I had sound before using `startx`.
Now, using Fin, PulseAudio doesn't recognize any of my
audio inputs or outputs. `pavucontrol` shows dummy sinks.

### Solution
Fin uses `bash --login` to run your `.xinitrc`, and therefore
imposes stricter requirements than `startx`. Create an `audio`
group if it does not already exist, and add your user to it.
Log out and back in to reload the group list.


## Notifications No Longer Work
### Problem
DBUS is not initialized properly in the `.xinitrc` you're using.
This is due to your `XDG` variables (which `startx` handles for
you) not being set properly. See
[this issue](https://github.com/FyshOS/fin/issues/5) for more
details.
### Solution
Be sure your XDG variables are set, such as
`export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u)` towards the top of
your `.xinitrc`. Failing to do so breaks dbus and as a result,
systemctl in user mode. Be sure your `.xinitrc` is compliant
with the recommendations of your distro, and properly sources
config files from `/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d` (if applicable).
